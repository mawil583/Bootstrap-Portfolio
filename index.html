                    <p>Hello! My name is Michael and I am a web developer. Well, kind of. I will be. But for now, I'm a
                        web
                        developer in training. But look at this website! Looks nice, huh?! That's because it is nice.
                        You should
                        really just hire me now. Wouldn't you like your website to look this good? I'm sure your
                        customers would
                        appreciate it. And who knows, maybe they would spend more time on your website if it looked this
                        good.
                        We all know that the more time people spend on your website, the more likely they are to
                        purchase your
                        product. So I'll help you increase your revenue, and you give me a job. It's a win-win!</p>
                    <p>This website was created from scratch using Bootstrap, which is a CSS framwork. It works by
                        referencing a CSS file in the head tag of HTML. This CSS file
                        is prewritten, so it's kind of like copy-pasting code that another programmer has developed. If
                        that seems too easy, you're right. It is.
                        In addition to copy-pasting, you have to make sure you have a good understanding of a grid
                        system in order to be proficient at Bootstrap. One of the great things about Bootstrap is that
                        it comes with a
                        pre-built responsiveness that makes the content respond to a resizing of the browser. This also
                        makes it compatible with mobile phones.
                    </p>

                    <p>In my portfolio section you'll see that the pictures are just place-holders. This is because I
                        haven't completed any projects yet. But they are soon to come! For now, just enjoy this
                        formatting masterpiece!</p>
